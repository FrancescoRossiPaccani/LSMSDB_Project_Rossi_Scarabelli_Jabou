We have to implement an application for passage-sharing like "bla-bla car".
In the system there will be 3 actors, the sistem, the drivers and the passangers.
The last two are the Users of the system.
An User can register in the system and can manage his profile.
While registering or managin his account he can adds cars that he owns and he can drive.

Passengers who have taken a trip with a driver can rate the ride and leave a review, which the driver can view on a dedicated page in the app.
A Driver can pubish a ride that he will do, while he publish that he had to see the trajectory that he have to made and he have to select one of his car, the one that he are going to use.
After he publish a ride he can/have to manage the request for a passage.
    He can see the profile of the passanger that made the request.
    He can accept the request.
    He can denied the request.

A passanger can see the ride that some driver publish in the app. He can filter the ride that going for a spot to another (near the spots). 
He can see the profile of the drivers that have publish a ride, the car and how much money the driver ask for the ride. (partition if the ride is smaller than the driver ride)
When a passanger choose the ride that he want, he can send a request to passage at the driver or he can change the request for example he can change the pickup point and the money that he are going to pay.  

The system notify both Drivers and Passangers when a notify is incoming.
When the driver accept the passanger's request the passanger have to pay at the system the money decided.
After a ride is finish the system send the money to the driver.
After a passanger's ride is finish he can rate the driver.
